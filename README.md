 Social Distance Alert with Convolutional Neural Network,OpenCV,YOLO3

1. Detect the humans in the frame with yolov3 convolutional neural network.
2. Calculate the distance between all the instances of humans detected in the frame.
3. Classify the determined distances as 'Alert' or 'Ok' for social distancing.

To run the notebook in colab you could just sign in your google collabaratory account and then run it in GPU runtime without any problem.
just download the weights and upload it in drive.
